# Yoda
Let the little green guy do the tedious docker work for you!

## What is it? 
Yoda is a command line tool used to interact with docker projects/containers based on Yaml configuration files. There are however some features that yoda does not have that Fig does have, and vice versa.

## Features
- Ability to pull, build and run containers and _all_ of their dependencies. 
- A repository of .yoda files that yoda can grab(and contribute to too!) to get you up and running even quicker!
- Wraps the CLI interface and relies more heavily on shell, thus making it more customizable. 
- Functionality for different environments built in(no need for additional config files based on env)
- A few more!!!

## Why create yoda when fig/compose exists? 
A couple reasons. Yoda is a pet project of mine. For a while now I've wanted to build an app in various languages(PHP, Go, Python) and figured, why not? This prototype is written in PHP(my bread and butter) but there should be more versions coming soon! Again, it's a learning experience for me too.

There were also some features that I felt were missing from fig that I personally would use or would've like to have seen(see above).
